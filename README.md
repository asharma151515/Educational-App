## **Design and Development Process**

The development process began with defining the **core mechanics** of the game.
I chose a **memory matching format**, where players must find pairs of matching images.

* This format promotes **cognitive skills**.
* Provides an **interactive way** for students to engage with content.
* Implemented using **GridLayout** in Android for an organized and visually appealing layout.

**Key Features:**

* **User-friendly interface** with clear instructions.
* **Feedback mechanisms**: when players match images, their **score increases** and they receive **instant visual feedback**.
* **Motivational elements** to keep students engaged.

## **Technical Implementation**

The game uses various **Android components** effectively:

* **MediaPlayer** â†’ background music for an immersive experience.
* **Dynamic Scoring System** â†’ provides real-time progress updates.
* **Game Logic** â†’ handles image selection and matching smoothly.

  * Prevents clicks on already matched buttons.
  * Manages game state effectively.

This careful coding improved **gameplay experience** while reinforcing concepts like **Android lifecycle management** and **event handling**.
